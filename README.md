# Overview

The purpose of this software is to demonstrate my knowledge of the C++ language. I wrote this software to give myself the opportunity to learn and practice writing in the C++ language. This is my first time writing in C++ and this is the first real program I have written in C++. I am hoping to use this software as a stepping stone to learn more about C++ and to write more complex programs in the future. As I want to be a data scientist, C++ will be an important language for me to learn and master.

The software takes a CSV file and cleans the data in it. Specifically, it converts the headers to lowercase and replaces spaces with underscores, and removes whitespace before opening parentheses. The software also converts true/false values to 1/0 and NULL values are replaced with "NULL". Additionally, it writes the cleaned data to a new CSV file.

Below is a video of the software in action:

# Future Work

A list of things that I would like to fix, improve or add to the project in the future:

- Add more data cleaning tasks.
- Improve performance for larger datasets.
- Implement more testing to ensure the software's correctness.
- Make the program more universal.
- Prompt the user for the file paths and file names.
